     * Spy Number = A Number is spy number if the sum of its digits equals the product of its digits.
         Example : consider the number 1124
         Sum of the digits = 1 + 1 + 2 + 8
         Product of the digits = 1 * 1 * 2 * 8
     *
     *A number is called Disarium if sum of its digits powered with their respective positions is 
     *equal to the number itself.
     *
     *niven number =
     *is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when
     *written in that base
     *
     *Armstrong
     *An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits 
     *is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371.
     *
     *Palindrome = A palindromic number or numeral palindrome is a number that remains the same when its 
     *digits are reversed. Like 16461,
     *
     *Neon
     *A number is said to be a Neon Number if the sum of digits of the square of the number is equal to the
     *number itself. Example- 9 is a Neon Number. 9*9=81 and 8+1=9.Hence it is a Neon Number.
     *
     *Automorphic=
     *Note: An automorphic number is a number which is present in the last digit(s) of its square.
     *Example: 25 is an automorphic number as its square is 625 and 25 is present as the last digits
     *
     *Special =
     * number is said to be special number when the sum of factorial of its digits is equal to the number 
     * itself. Example- 145 is a Special Number as 1!+4!+5!=145.
     * 
     * Pronic Number :
     * A pronic number, oblong number, rectangular number or heteromecic number, is a number which is the
     * product of two consecutive integers, that is, n (n + 1).
     *The first few pronic numbers are:
     *0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90, 110, 132, 156, 182, 210, 240, 272, 306, 342, 380, 420, 462 â€¦ etc.
